## CS 330 Graphic Design and Visualization
**1. How do I approach designing software?**
> I carefully read the project requirements and make a large scale list (unless one is provided). I try to break it down into manageable steps and check off requirements as I meet them.

**2. What new design skills has your work on the project helped you to craft?**
> I had never done anything like this before. I am not very artistic and my last experience with graphic design was messing around with Photoshop 7.0 about 20 years ago. The work I did on this project helped me better "see" in my mind's eye how a 3-dimensional space works as part of a coordinate system.

**3. What design process did you follow for your project work?**
> At first I attempted to stick to the photo, but I realized quickly that I made it too hard for myself given my level of experience. So instead I created a scene that was inspired by the original image, but does not reflect it very much.

**4. How could tactics from your design approach be applied in future work?**
> I think it's important to have the skills to be able to improvise even when the original plan isn't working.

**5. How do I approach developing programs?**
> I like to keep my code neat and readable. I'm trying to get better at creating modular code so that I can use them in future projects.

**6. What new development strategies did you use while working on your 3D scene?**
> Honestly, I just tried my best to keep up with the assignments. I watched a lot of videos and looked at a lot of tutorials.

**7. How did iteration factor into your development?**
> I ran and compiled my code so many times, because otherwise I wasn't able to see the changes I was making. Each time I adjusted something, I ran it again to see what changed.

**8. How has your approach to developing code evolved throughout the milestones, which led you to the projectâ€™s completion?**
> As I worked through each module, information that I just accepted at first suddenly started to make sense as part of a whole.

**9. How can computer science help me in reaching my goals?**
> My goals are to prevent cybersecurity attacks on public entities or supply chains. It would be impossible to work in this field without a computer science background.

**10. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future educational pathway?**
> I may need these skills in the creation of future programs when building the UI.

**11. How do computational graphics and visualizations give you new knowledge and skills that can be applied in your future professional pathway?**
> I am not sure as of yet, but no knowledge is ever wasted.
